                <p class="description">In 1826, Joseph Nicéphore Niépce created the first permanent photograph titled "View from the Window at Le Gras" using a process he named heliography. This groundbreaking technique involved exposing a pewter plate coated with Bitumen of Judea to light. The process took several hours of exposure to capture an image. Niépce's pioneering work laid the foundation for modern photography and revolutionized the way we capture and preserve moments.</p>

                <p class="description">Louis Daguerre, in 1839, unveiled the Daguerreotype, a process that drastically reduced exposure time and improved image clarity. This method involved treating a silver-coated copper plate with iodine vapor to create a light-sensitive surface. The Daguerreotype became the first commercially successful photographic process and was widely used for portrait photography, capturing vivid details and expressions.</p>

                <p class="description">In 1851, Frederick Scott Archer introduced the Collodion process, significantly enhancing photographic quality and speed. This process used a glass plate coated with a thin layer of collodion, then sensitized, exposed, and developed within minutes. It provided sharper, more stable images and was less expensive than Daguerreotypes, making photography more accessible to the public.</p>
